# Project goal: 

Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

## Background: 

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. 

## Scenario: 

Your team is in the early stages of their user churn project. Your project proposal has been approved and your team has been given access to Waze’s user data. To get clear insights, the data must first be inspected, organized, and prepared for analysis. 

## Tasks:

* Import data

* Create a dataframe 

* Inspect data 

* Identify outliers

* Create a data visualization

* Share an executive summary with the Waze data team 

**_Note:_** *The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.*
